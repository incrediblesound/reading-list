This is a list of books that I would reccommend to anyone. I omit books that I feel I enjoyed primarily because they appealed to my personal taste, and instead try to stick to books I feel have a deeper value that cuts across individual tastes and interests.

Readability key:   
**[ L ]** = light, enjoyable reading   
**[ H ]** = enjoyable read that contains deeper or more technical topics, you might need to look up words
and concepts if you're not familiar with the subject matter.
**[ T ]** = heavy technical reading, challenging if you're not familiar with the subject   

# Science

 - The Logic of Life by Fran√ßois Jacob **[ H ]** This history of biological thought shows you 
how the development of biological concepts and scientific methods developed in tandem over time

 - Ontogeny and Phylogeny by S.J Gould **[ T ]** This books begins with an exploration of the discredited
 idea that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, and transitions into a somewhat heavier exploration
 of developmental timing.
 
# History

- Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel Durant **[ L ]** This eleven volume set is a pleasant way to dive into
the history of western civilization. A great starting point for those who are interesting in history but
don't have a particular topic they want to explore.

# Psychology

- Personality Types by Carl Jung **[ L ]** The source of the Myers-Briggs test, it's illuminating to see how 
such an influential categorization was developed through literary analysis.

# Literature

- The Decameron by Boccacio **[ L ]** The Decameron is a compendium of ancient stories and folk-tales re-told by Boccaccio.
