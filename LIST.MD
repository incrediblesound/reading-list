This is a list of books that I would reccommend to anyone. I generally try to stick to books I feel have a value that cuts across individual tastes and interests, but occasionally may include more niche books if I feel they deserve mention.

Readability key:   
**[ L ]** = light, enjoyable reading   
**[ H ]** = enjoyable read that contains deeper or more technical topics, you might need to look up words
and concepts if you're not familiar with the subject matter.   
**[ T ]** = heavy technical reading, challenging if you're not familiar with the subject   

# Science

 - _The Logic of Life_ by Fran√ßois Jacob **[ H ]** This history of biological thought shows you 
how the development of biological concepts and scientific methods developed in tandem over time

 - _Ontogeny and Phylogeny_ by S.J Gould **[ T ]** This books begins with an exploration of the discredited
 idea that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, and transitions into a somewhat heavier exploration
 of developmental timing.
 
 - _Causality and Modern Science_ by Mario Bunge **[ H ]** provides an in-depth discussion of some of the core issues of science: empiricism, determinism, and causality.
 
 - _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ by Thomas Kuhn **[ H ]** One of the most important books in the philosophy and the history of science.
 
# History

- _Story of Civilization_ by Will and Ariel Durant **[ L ]** This eleven volume set is a pleasant way to dive into
the history of western civilization. A great starting point for those who are interesting in history but
don't have a particular topic they want to explore.

- _Dissent and the Supreme Court: Its Role in the Court's History and the Nation's Constitutional Dialogue_ by Melvin I. Urofsky **[ H ]** Far from just a history of dissent, this book will give you insight into consitutional law, what it is, how it operates, and what role the supreme court plays in the US government.

# Psychology

- _Personality Types_ by Carl Jung **[ L ]** The source of the Myers-Briggs test, it's illuminating to see how 
such an influential categorization was developed through literary analysis.

- _Biology and Knowledge_ by Jean Piaget **[ T ]** A dense, complicated book that presents the theory of 
cognitive development that Piaget worked on for most of his life.

# Literature

- _The Decameron_ by Boccacio **[ L ]** The Decameron is a compendium of ancient stories and folk-tales re-told by Boccaccio. It's a window into life in the 14th century, a historically valuable repository of old stories, and an entertaining mix of funny, erotic, and tragic tales many of which are timeless.

- _Labyrinth of Solitude_ by Octavio Paz **[ L ]** contains multiple different forms of literature including history ancient and modern, prose exposition and poetry, all about Mexico and it's people, culture, and spirit.

- _Labyrinths_ by Jorge Luis Borges **[ L ]** A collection of mind-blowing short stories.

- _A Fool's Life_ by Akutagawa Ryunosuke **[ L ]** A collection of reflections and reminiscences by one of the greatest Japanese storytellers of all time. Despite having the "light" flag, this book was composed before the author committed suicide so it does have some heavier themes.

- _Pavilion of Women_ by Pearl S. Buck **[ L ]** tells the tale of the matriarch of a noble Chinese family who decides to retire into seclusion to study philosophy, and how that decision affects her life and her family.

# Chinese Literature

- _Peach Blossom Spring_ by Tao Qian **[ L ]** A short story written almost two thousand years ago about a fisherman who finds a secret passage to hidden mountain village. Accessible online here: http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/ps/china/taoqian_peachblossom.pdf

- _Dao De Jing_ by Lao Zi **[ L ]** is an ancient political text based on a mystical philosophy and presented in the form of 81 poems. Along with Confucianism and Buddhism it forms the core of eastern philosophy. The best version in my opinion is by Robert G. Hendricks, but the Ursula K. Le Guin version is probably more accessible to a general audience.

# Travel

- _Journey to the Abyss: The Diaries of Count Harry Kessler 1880-1918_ **[ L ]** Harry Kessler was a German diplomat who travelled the world. His diaries are considered historically significant because they contain descriptions of such a wide variety of people and places. On one page he's accompanying Rodin on a ferry-boat ride, on another he's consulting with Nietzsche's sister about what should be done with the deceased thinker's manuscripts. I particularly like his colorful descriptions of late 19th century United States.

- _Tent Life in Siberia_ by George Kennan. In the late 19th century George Kennan was tasked with exploring northeast Siberia to survey the land for the trans-Siberian telegraph line. This book is a beautifully written account of his journey through Siberia, how he survived in some of the harshest landscapes on earth, and the native people he stayed with along the way.
