This is a list of books that I would reccommend to anyone. I generally try to stick to books I feel have a value that cuts across individual tastes and interests, but occasionally may include more niche books if I feel they deserve mention.

Readability key:   
**[ L ]** = light, enjoyable reading   
**[ H ]** = enjoyable read that contains deeper or more technical topics, you might need to look up words
and concepts if you're not familiar with the subject matter.   
**[ T ]** = heavy technical reading, challenging if you're not familiar with the subject   

# Science

 - The Logic of Life by Fran√ßois Jacob **[ H ]** This history of biological thought shows you 
how the development of biological concepts and scientific methods developed in tandem over time

 - Ontogeny and Phylogeny by S.J Gould **[ T ]** This books begins with an exploration of the discredited
 idea that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, and transitions into a somewhat heavier exploration
 of developmental timing.
 
# History

- Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel Durant **[ L ]** This eleven volume set is a pleasant way to dive into
the history of western civilization. A great starting point for those who are interesting in history but
don't have a particular topic they want to explore.

# Psychology

- Personality Types by Carl Jung **[ L ]** The source of the Myers-Briggs test, it's illuminating to see how 
such an influential categorization was developed through literary analysis.

- Biology and Knowledge by Jean Piaget **[ T ]** 

# Literature

- The Decameron by Boccacio **[ L ]** The Decameron is a compendium of ancient stories and folk-tales re-told by Boccaccio. It's a window into life in the 14th century, a historically valuable repository of old stories, and an entertaining mix of funny, erotic, and tragic tales many of which are timeless.

- Labyrinth of Solitude by Octavio Paz **[ L ]** contains multiple different forms of literature including history ancient and modern, prose exposition and poetry, all about Mexico and it's people, culture, and spirit.

# Chinese Literature

- Peach Blossom Spring by Tao Qian **[ L ]** A short story written almost two thousand years ago about a fisherman who finds a secret passage to hidden mountain village. Accessible online here: http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/ps/china/taoqian_peachblossom.pdf

- Dao De Jing by Lao Zi **[ L ]** is an ancient political text based on a mystical philosophy and presented in the form of 81 poems. Along with Confucianism and Buddhism it forms the core of eastern philosophy. The best version in my opinion is by Robert G. Hendricks, but the Ursula K. Le Guin version is probably more accessible to a general audience.
